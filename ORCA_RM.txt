ORCA™ MOTORS
RM220115

Powering the Motor
ORCA motors are powered by DC voltage. The ORCA motors variant name specifies the
voltage at which the motor is most efficient, however all ORCA motors can be powered by 12
– 60 VDC.
Flying lead power connections are provided for each motor. ORCA motors are configured to
be able to draw significant currents and proper attachment of the power lines to a suitable
power source is important.
Suitable power sources for ORCA motors are AC-to-DC converters, batteries of various
chemistry, capacitor banks, or other sources of DC voltages. Engineering support from Iris
Dynamics on the selection of a suitable power source is available.

Fuse
A 30-amp fast-blow fuse must be installed between the power supply and the motor. This
fuse will be destroyed if negative voltage is applied to the motor.

Ground
In all cases, the black power lead is “Ground” and should be connected to the negative
terminal of the power supply or battery.
It is important that the power supply Ground, and the Ground of any electronics attached to
the device’s communication cable is kept at the same level. Usually this is done by making
sure the power supplies of the motor and external controller (if different) are connected to
Earth at both their chassis and negative output terminal.

Chassis
As an important safety measure, the chassis of the motor must be securely connected to
Earth. Proper grounding of the chassis is also important for proper operation of the motor.
The motor enclosure and cable shields are connected but these are not connected to the
Ground circuit of the on-board electronics. Therefore, a separate connection from the Chassis
to Earth must be made which can be accommodated by threading a conductive bolt into any
of the provided thread patterns on the enclosure.

Methods of Motor Control
Modbus RTU Serial Interface
ORCA motors feature a ‘field-bus’ serial communication interface which allows configuration,
control, and monitoring. Features of the motors are offered by exposing data fields (registers)
which can be written to and read from by sending and receiving characters over the serial
interface. Serial communications are implemented using a subset of the Modbus RTU
specification, with additional functionality to support a high-speed stream of commands and
feedback.
See the ORCA Memory Map for a list of register addresses. A PLC, PC, or other Modbus client
can be used to command the motor. Third party programs with built in Modbus libraries or
serial libraries such as Labview, or Matlab can also be used. There is an IrisSDK for Windows
available with C++ libraries that abstract the Modbus communications for use in custom
software solutions.
The Modbus RTU User Manual, along with manuals for specific client interfaces, links to git
repository with source code are available for download at irisdynamics.com/downloads.

IrisControls Software
ORCA motors feature an optional graphical user interface called IrisControls which can be
used to monitor details and configure settings. This interface provides an easy way to visually
tune the internal PID position controller, set up motion profiles, add performance restrictions,
and capture information while connected. See the Getting Started With IrisControls section of
this document for full details.

IO SmartHub (optional and sold separately)
The IO SmartHub provides control of ORCA motors in Force, Position, and Kinematic Modes
through simple digital and analog inputs. Real-time force and position data are fed back from
the motor and provided as analog outputs. The IO SmartHub attaches to the motor’s data
cable (RJ45) and allows easier integration with existing industrial control
methods such as PLCs with 4-20 mA current loop outputs. Find more information in the IO
SmartHub User Guide at irisdynamics.com/downloads.

ORCA™ MOTORS
RM220115

Modes of Operation
The motor operates in five main modes of operation: Sleep Mode (1), Force Mode (2), Position
Mode (3), Haptic Mode (4), and Kinematic Mode (5). Force Mode (2) and Position Mode (3) are
meant to be used with a Modbus communication stream and cannot be entered directly
through the IrisControls GUI.

Sleep Mode (1)
In this mode, power drivers are not active and windings in the stator are all shorted
(producing a braking effect). Force and position commands are ignored.
When Sleep Mode (1) is commanded (even when Sleep Mode is currently active), any active
errors will be re-evaluated and cleared where appropriate.

Force Mode (2)
The force controller will control the power delivered to the motor to achieve the forces written
to the FORCE_CMD register. Note: this register is double-wide (32 bits) and read as a signed
32 bit integer.
Once in Force Mode (2), communications must be made regularly over the Modbus interface to
avoid a timeout error. In the event of communications failure or other motor errors, the motor
will cease all power draw and produce zero force output.

Position Mode (3)
The position controller will calculate forces for and command the force controller according to
the configured PID tuning, the setpoint, and the current shaft position.
Before entering Position Mode (3), the user should make sure the shaft has been zeroed to a
known position, either manually or through the autozeroing feature.
Once in Position Mode (3), communications must be made regularly over the Modbus interface
to avoid a timeout error. In the event of communications failure or other motor errors, the
motor will cease all power draw and put the windings into a passive braking effect.

Haptic Mode (4)
In Haptic Mode, the force controller works similarly to Force Mode, however, force commands
will be dictated by the haptic controller rather than a Modbus stream. The haptic controller
comprises several haptic force effects that can be configured and enabled. The sum of forces

resulting from all enabled haptic effects is used as the force target. A Modbus stream can be
used to update the constant force effect, or updating other effect configurations.

Kinematic Mode (5)
In Kinematic Mode, the position controller works similarly to when in Position Mode (3),
however, position targets will be dictated by the kinematic controller rather than a Modbus
stream.
The kinematic controller outputs motion profiles to move to a shaft position over a specified
time, while respecting the chosen kinematic constraints. The Modbus interface can be used in
this mode to configure motion profiles and trigger motions.

Pulse Width Mode (11)
In Pulse Width Mode, the position controller works similarly to when in Position Mode (3),
however, position targets will be dictated by the width of incoming pulses. In this mode, the
motor can effectively be controlled like an RC servo motor.
Use of this mode requires additional hardware described in the Pulse Width Control section.

Auto Zeroing Mode (55)
This mode is available to put the motor into a routine that will automatically retract the shaft
until reaching a hard stop, and set the zero position to that location. Once the zeroing routine
is complete the motor will move into the specified Exit Mode.
More information on the Auto Zeroing feature can be found in the Auto Zeroing section.

Required Hardware
Besides the motor itself, connecting to the IrisControls application requires two additional
pieces of hardware detailed below.

​

ORCA motor

RS485 to USB cable

RJ45 Splitter

Connect the RJ45 communication cable from the ORCA motors to the single port side of the
RJ45 splitter. Connect the RJ45 connector end of the blue RS485 cable to the splitter input
labeled 1 or A. Finally, connect the USB end of the blue RS485 cable to the Windows PC
running IrisControls.

Connecting to IrisControls
Ensure that the motor is connected to a PC with an RS485 to USB cable. Open the IrisControls
application. Using the COM selection dropdown menu at the bottom of the window, select
either ORCA (if it is present) or the COM port of the USB to RS485 connection. If neither option
is present, ensure that the hardware is connected correctly as specified.

IrisControls Connection Information

Once the correct device is selected, press the connect button to begin attempting to connect
to the motor. If successful, the ORCA GUI should launch its homepage.

Troubleshooting Connection
Correct Splitter Port
If the COM port does not show up in the drop down menu, ensure that the blue RS485 to USB
cable is plugged into port 1 or A of the RJ Splitter and that the motor’s data cable is plugged
into the single side of the splitter.

FTDI Drivers
If the COM port does not show up in the drop down menu, it may be due to not having the
FTDI Virtual COM Port drivers installed. Most newer Windows operating systems have these
drivers included, but they can also be found at https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/.

Too Many Rows / Columns Requested Error
This error can arise from a combination of a screen’s scaling and the size of the display. The
first option to resolve this is to turn down the screen scaling (windows key -> ‘scaling’ ->
“Change the size of text, apps, and other items”).

GUI Baudrate
If the motor does not connect, toggle the connect button off and press the gear icon in the top
right of the IrisControls window and select a baudrate of 460800 from the dropdown menu,
and press apply.

Low Framerate
If the GUI is refreshing at a low framerate (less than 20 Hz), this can be caused by the COM
port latency value. On Windows, open the device manager, and navigate to the Ports (COM &

Position / Kinematics Page
The position page provides a real time graph displaying the target position, measured
position, and target force of the motor. Below the graph, the currently set parameters of the
position controller are displayed, including proportional gain, integral gain, derivative gain, and
maximum force output. These values can be tuned and are described in further detail in the
PID Position Controller section.

IrisControls Position Page

Position and Force Graph
This graph will plot the position controller’s target position, the commanded force used to
reach that position, the measured shaft position, and the individual actions of each
component of the PID controller. The left y-axis is position, and the right y-axis is force.
The green “Target” line will show the active commanded position. (Modbus or Kinematic
Controller).
The blue “Position” line indicates the motor’s sensed position.
The other lines indicate the overall force being commanded to the motor and the contributions
from each PID parameter to that force.

PID Tuning - Max Force / Gain Adjustment
The maximum force output and position controller gains can be edited here.
The maximum force (Fmax) determines the upper limit of force that the position controller can
command.
The number on the left of the arrow is the actual value that is in effect and is not editable. This
value will only be populated when the position controller is active either in Position Mode (3)
or Kinematic Mode (5)
The number on the right side of the arrow is the target gain value. This value can be manually
edited and applied with the Apply Tuning button and saved with the Save Tuning button.
Softstart Duration configures the duration that forces generated by the position controller will
linearly ramp up over when entering the mode.

Sensor Sliders
Three sliders show the current values for position, speed and acceleration.

Application Note:
Configuring and Using Auto Zeroing From the IrisControls GUI
To use the Auto Zeroing feature from the GUI:
1.​ Navigate to the Position / Kinematics page. If the Kinematic controls are showing,
press the Set PID Tuning button to switch to the tuning panel.
2.​ Select a valid zeroing configuration from the Zeroing Configuration dropdown. If an
invalid zeroing configuration is selected, the Start Auto Zeroing button will be disabled.
Valid settings include:
○​ Auto Zero Enabled
○​ Auto Zero on Boot
○​ IOSH Auto Zeroing
3.​ Configure the maximum allowable force to be exerted during the Auto Zeroing routine,
in Newtons. This is done through the Max Force input. Note that this force may be
exerted for a short period of time (<200 ms) when the shaft reaches its hard stop. It’s
important to set this parameter high enough such that the motor is still able to move
its load.
4.​ Configure the speed at which the shaft should move during the Auto Zeroing routine, in
millimeters per second. This is done through the Shaft Speed input.
5.​ Select the mode of operation the motor should transition into after finishing Auto
Zeroing. This is done through the Exit Mode dropdown. Upon successful completion of
Auto Zeroing, the motor will immediately enter the specified mode.
6.​ To initiate Auto Zeroing from the GUI, press the Start Auto Zero button. This button is
only available if a valid mode is selected as described in step 1.

Application Note:
Continuous Looping Sequence
It is possible to set up a single motion profile that will start on motor boot up and loop
indefinitely without any external control, i.e., motor with power supply only, data cable not
used.
This can be done by setting a sequence of motions that all ‘Auto-start Next’ and having the
last motion’s ‘Next ID’ be the first in the sequence. The ‘Home Motion ID’ should be set to the
first motion in the sequence. When Kinematic Mode (5) is entered, each motion will be
performed sequentially as defined by the ‘Next ID’ parameter. Delays between motions can
be added as required.

Application Notes:
50 N force for 1 second followed by 9 seconds of rest.
To accomplish this type of setup the ‘Oscillator’ and ‘Constant’ effects are used in
combination. Using a 25 N amplitude for the oscillator will give a 50 N spread between the
maximum and minimum values. Using a ‘Constant’ effect with 25 N will add an offset to the
oscillator. Instead of alternating between +25 N and -25 N, the force will alternate between 0
N and 50 N. Setting the Frequency to 1 dHz will have the waveform repeat every 10 seconds
(which is the total time ‘high’ and ‘low’). Setting the Duty to 10 will give 1 second high and 9
seconds low.

Force Graph when 25 N Constant Force and 25 N Amplitude Pulse Oscillator with 10% Duty Cycle

Testing of High Force
Set up a ‘Spring’ effect with a large dead zone and high Gain to create virtual hard stops.
Then use a ‘Constant’ effect to the desired force. This will allow for the demonstration of high
forces within a range of the shaft without pushing against hard stops.

Force Sensor
Forces resulting from current in the motor windings, whether caused by the motor drivers, or
by currents induced due to shaft movement, is calculated, and reported with low latency and
high bandwidth.

Position Sensor
The position of the shaft is measured and reported with low latency and high bandwidth. The
reported position can be set to zero by writing to the “Zero Position” bit of “Control Register 0.”
The ORCA motor will take its current shaft position as zero at startup every time the motor is
power cycled as the absolute position will be lost if the motor loses 5V.
Depending on the configuration, the motor will either continuously zero the position value
when moving in the negative direction or negative values can be valid. The default direction of
positive travel is the shaft moving away from the cable side. The positive position direction
can also be inverted by writing to the invert position bit flag in Control Register 0.
The shaft position is obtained by measuring and integrating the ‘shaft alignment,’ or the
position of the shaft’s magnets with respect to the stator.
The shaft alignment is absolute in nature (persists throughout power cycles); however, it
repeats every shaft period interval. This interval is listed on the motor’s datasheet as “Shaft
Magnetic Period.”
The position sensor is active in all modes of operation.

Power Sensor
Power being consumed or generated is measured and reported with low latency and high
bandwidth. This power is a measure of the heat being generated by the stators and is not
necessarily an accurate reflection of the power drawn from the supply, especially when the
shaft is moving quickly. The power sensor reflects the rate at which the stator will be
increasing in temperature.

Temperature Sensors
The temperature of the power driver and the stator windings are measured and reported to
the ORCA registers.
The temperature of the electronics can be obtained by reading the BOARD_TEMP register.
The stator coil temperature can be obtained by reading the COIL_TEMP register. This value
represents the temperature of the windings and is a calculated estimate based on
thermocouple reading and power draw.
Each of the temperature readings has an individually configurable maximum value before an
error is thrown. See User Configurations.

Controllers
The integrated logic included in ORCA motors carries out several feedforward and feedback
controllers with very low latency loops that provide high performance motion and force control
without a lot of tuning and setup required.

Force Controller
Internal control loops control the phase currents in the motor to achieve a commanded force,
compensating for shaft position, speed, winding temperature, and supply voltage. There are
no user tuning parameters for the force controller, and calibration is typically done during
manufacturing.
The force controller acts on commands from the position controller when the motor is in
Position Mode (3) or Kinematic Mode (5), acts on commands from Modbus when in Force
Mode (2), and commands from the haptic controller when in Haptic Mode (4).

Position Controller
A common use of linear motors, especially in kinematic robotic applications, is to move to and
hold position in the presence of dynamic disturbances. The integrated PID position controller
accomplishes this by using the position sensor as feedback and generating a force command
which will realize the position setpoint effectively. Position setpoint means the position target
commanded via Modbus or from the kinematic controller.
When tuning the PID position controller in a new system, it is always recommended to start
with as low a force saturation level as possible.

General Tuning Guide
The easiest way to tune the position controller is using the ORCA GUI. The “Position” tab
allows easy editing of the gains, enabling and disabling of the controller, and a real-time view
of the target position, the actual position, and the controller force output.
There is no shortage of PID tuning guides available on the internet and tuning of the
integrated PID position controller follows most traditional PID controllers. The reader is
encouraged to research the term “PID position controller” if the concepts are unfamiliar prior
to using this feature.
Specific optimal tuning will depend on the nature of the load and any disturbances
experienced. Default tuning values are based on standard shaft lengths and default kinematic
motion profile. Different speed profiles and load may affect tuning requirements.

Force Saturation Level
Units: millinewtons (mN)
This setting limits the maximum force the position controller will generate in either direction.

Proportional Action
Units: millinewtons-per-micrometer (mN / µm)
The ‘P’ in PID is “proportional gain” and will act like a spring; the further the shaft is from its
setpoint, the more force the controller will apply. Higher P-gain results in a stronger spring
effect.
ORCA motors have fast feedback loops which enable relatively high proportional gains. In
systems where some steady-state error may be acceptable, it is possible to achieve good
motion control using only the proportional action.
In precise systems where small errors are unacceptable, Integral gain should be added after
Proportional gain to remove steady state errors.
The proportional gain register value is scaled up by a factor of 64 for increased resolution.

Integral Action
Units: millinewton-seconds-per-micrometer (mN·s / µm)
Integral action takes any small errors in position and accumulates action to correct them over
time. For example, if an error of 1 millimeter is present for 1 second, an I-gain of 1000 will
generate 1 Newton of corrective force. A second later this force will be 2 N. This will continue
until enough force is accumulated to remove the 1 mm of error.
Integral gain is inherently unstable and must be used in combination with proportional gain to
prevent oscillation.
Higher I-gain will remove steady state errors faster but could cause instability, especially
when the position setpoint is moved rapidly, or sharp disturbances (e.g., kicking the shaft) are
encountered.
The integral gain register value is scaled up by a factor of 64 for increased resolution.

Derivative Action (Velocity)
Units: millinewton-millimeters-per-second (mN·mm / s)
In this context, derivative action is a force acting against the speed of the shaft. The action
feels like a damper on the shaft and can prevent it from reaching high speeds.

This action is often not required, especially when fast transient response is desired. However,
D-gain will prevent the shaft from moving too fast and can improve stability and reduce
overshoot.
It is safe to use derivative action alone if a brake force is required. The derivative gain register
value is scaled up by a factor of 2 for increased resolution.

Derivative Action (Error)
Units: millinewton-millimeters-per-second (mN·mm / s)
As an alternative to derivative action based on velocity, a derivative action based on error is
also available. The end effect of both derivative actions is quite similar and can be used in
similar situations.
The derivative action acts proportional to the change in error between the setpoint and
measured position.
The derivative gain register value is scaled up by a factor of 2 for increased resolution.

Auto Zeroing
The auto zeroing algorithm is intended to bring the shaft to the fully retracted position until it
reaches a hard stop, and zero the position reading at that point. This process can be initiated
by commanding the ORCA motor to enter Auto Zero Mode (55). Auto Zeroing can also be
initiated through the GUI, or configured to start when the ORCA motor boots up.

Configuration
Auto Zeroing mode must be enabled through selecting a valid value in the ZERO_MODE
register to use the Auto Zeroing routine. The Auto Zeroing process has configuration options
that may need to be tweaked for different applications. All relevant registers and their values
are described in the Register Descriptions table. If configuration through the IrisControls GUI is
preferred, the Configuring and Using Auto Zeroing From the IrisControls GUI provides an
example.

Zero Mode
The valid ZERO_MODE register settings for Auto Zeroing are
●​ Auto Zero Enabled
Auto Zeroing mode is enabled, but is only started through the “Start Auto Zero” button

initiated either by Modbus messages, or from digital triggers through the IO SmartHub.

Software Triggering
Motions can be initiated by writing the desired motion ID number to the
KIN_SW_TRIG[MOTION_ID] field. This register will be set to 0x1000 initially and will return to

Haptic Controller
ORCA motors are equipped with a haptic controller that provides a series of force effects
which can be combined to create force targets based on shaft position, speed, and
acceleration, in addition to periodic force options. The sum of the haptic effects is sent as the
force target to the force controller.

Effects
The status of each effect is contained in the HAPTIC_STATUS register. Each bit position
represents whether a single effect is enabled or disabled. A 1 represents an active effect that
will produce force, and a 0 represents a disabled effect. Effects may be configured as well as
toggled on and off while the motor is in Haptic Mode for dynamic effects. Note that the motor
must be in Haptic Mode for any of the effects to produce force.

Below is a description of each type of effect and their configurations.
●​ Constant: This effect applies a constant force to the haptic controller. This is also a

o​ Force (mN): Constant force.
o​ Filter Strength (0-10000): Strength of low pass filter applied to the constant
force input.
●​ Spring: The spring effects apply a force that linearly increases as the shaft is moved
away from the center location.
o​ Gain (N/mm): Rate at which the force will increase proportional to the change in
position.
o​ Center (µm): Location of spring center.
o​ Dead Zone (mm): Indicates a distance around either side of the center in which
the spring effect doesn’t apply.
o​ Saturation (N): The maximum force that will be output by this spring effect, if
set to 0 no force limit will exist.
o​ Coupling (+/-):​Type of spring behaviour.
▪​ +/-: Spring will act in both directions.
▪​ +: Spring forces only applied when moving the shaft in the positive
direction beyond the center.

-: Spring forces only applied when moving the shaft in the negative
direction beyond the center.

●​ Damper: The damper effect applies a force to reduce the speed of the motor’s
movement.
o​ Gain (N·s/mm): Rate at which the force increases proportional to the speed of
the motor.
●​ Inertia: The inertia effect applies a force that attempts to reduce the acceleration of the
motor. This makes it both more difficult to get the shaft in motion, but also keep the
shaft in motion once moved.
o​ Gain (N·s2/mm): Rate at which the force increases proportional to the
acceleration of the motor.
●​ Oscillator: The oscillator effects apply periodic forces in the shape of various
waveforms.
o​ Amplitude (N): The peak force of the waveform, oscillators are centered on 0 N
of force so the force will oscillate between negative amplitude and positive
amplitude values. Note: adding a constant force effect with an oscillator will
change the force around which the waveform oscillates.
o​ Frequency (dHz): Frequency of the oscillation in decihertz. (1 dHz = 0.1 Hz)
o​ Duty (%): This field only applies to ‘Pulse’ waveforms, the duty indicates what
percentage of the waveform should be spent in a ‘high’ state (applying positive
force) with the remaining percent being in the ‘low’ state.
o​ Type: The waveform pattern can be selected from the dropdown.
▪​ Pulse: Square wave that alternates between the positive amplitude
value and the negative amplitude value. The duty cycle is used to
determine the portion of the period each direction of force is active.
▪​ Sine: Sinusoidal waveform.
▪​ Triangle: Linearly increases force, then reverses and linearly decreases
force.
▪​ Sawtooth: Linearly increases from negative amplitude value to positive
amplitude value over entire period, then sharply go back to negative
amplitude value

Pulse Width Control
With the addition of a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Interface board (available for purchase
as a motor accessory), the motor position can be controlled with a typical RC servo pulse
width signal. While typical servos control their position between 0 and 180 degrees, the
motor will control its position between any two configurable values.
With Auto Zeroing configured to run on power up and to go directly into Pulse Width Mode,
the motor operates analogously to a servo motor.
Note that Modbus communications will be entirely disabled in Pulse Width Mode (11).

Supported Input Signal Parameters
Supported Input Frequency: 40 Hz to 400 Hz
Supported Pulse Widths:
●​ 1.0ms to 2.0ms
●​ 0.5ms to 2.5ms

Hardware Interface
In Pulse Width mode, the Modbus interface is repurposed for PWM input. To facilitate this, Iris
Dynamics offers an Interface PCB to easily connect PWM signals directly to the motors data
cable.

ESD Rating: IEC 61000-4-2 Level 4

5V Input
The 5V input is optional and can be used to provide emergency logic power to the motor, in
case the motor’s power supply is disabled. If the motor’s power supply is turned off or
disconnected and there is a source of 5 V applied to the PWM interface, the logic will continue
to function. This is beneficial as the motor will continue to track its position and not require a
zeroing routine when power is reapplied.
Maximum Voltage Input: 5.2 V
Minimum Voltage Input to retain logic: 4.0 V

Ground
This ground input on the interface must be connected to the PWM controller ground. If 5V is
applied to the motor for backup logic power, the 5V source and the PWM controller should all
connect to the same ground as closely as possible.

Motor Connector
The motor data cable should be plugged directly into the RJ45 port labeled “MOTOR” on the
interface PCB. Note that no splitter from the ORCA Starter kit should be connected, the
interface PCB essentially replaces the splitter.

IrisControls Connection
The RJ45 port labeled “USB” on the interface board can accept the USB-to-RS485 used to
connect a motor to IrisControls via USB. This may be used simultaneously with the PWM
input, or may be omitted.

Configuring Pulse Width Control
There are 5 configurable parameters for Pulse Width mode, which can be set directly through
Modbus registers, or the GUI.

This way, the hysteresis introduces a temperature gap that reduces the chance of thermally
stressing the motor.

Maximum Force
The motor has no default maximum force threshold, but one can be set which will limit forces
beyond this level, and throw a Force Exceeded error (128). Setting the register to zero disables
this threshold.

Maximum Power
If the power burned in the motor exceeds this or the device’s default threshold, the drivers will
be disabled, preventing power draw. Setting this register to zero or higher than the default
setting will result in the motor only powering down when unsafe levels are reached. See the
Power Exceeded section for more information.

By default, Force Mode (2), Position Mode (3), and Haptic Mode (4) will timeout when serial
communications are interrupted for longer than the timeout period. This timeout period can be
adjusted with this user setting.

Errors
The motor will generate error codes when a user setting, or a device limit is reached or
exceeded. Depending on the error, certain features will not be available until the error is
cleared.
Some errors, like temperature and power, which trigger when a parameter exceeds a device
maximum can be configured using motor registers to trigger earlier as the application
requires.
Other errors, like force, will never trigger unless the registers are configured.

Active and Latched Error Registers
Errors which are currently in effect are reflected in the ERROR_0 register. Any time an error is
asserted, its flag will also appear in the ERROR_1 register and will remain asserted until
cleared by a write to the CONTROL_REG_0 [ clear_errors_flag ]. For example, if a temperature
error becomes active, it will show up in both registers. Once the temperature falls below the
error level and the motor is brought to Sleep Mode (1), the error will be cleared from ERROR_0
but not from ERROR_1.

*These errors do not completely disable control in position mode, but force the tuning to be
purely damped for safe recovery. The DV gain value that will be applied can be set through
the SAFETY_DGAIN register.

Configuration Errors (1)
These errors indicate calibrations or settings have not been done or have been made invalid.
These errors can be cleared by running the appropriate calibration routine, followed by
committing the valid results to permanent memory.

Force Clipping (32)
When the force controller is commanded to output forces that would require a phase to
exceed its rated current, the Force Clipping error is asserted. This error has no effect on
operation except to inform the user that linear force output has been compromised. The error
self clears as soon as the condition is removed.

Temperature Exceeded (64)
When the temperature of the stator windings or of the motor driver exceeds the device or
user-set maximum, a Temperature Exceeded error is asserted. This error is cleared when
entering Sleep Mode (1) or when the CONTROL_REG_0 [clear_errors_flag] is set ONLY if the
board and coil temperatures are both below their configured maximums. A hysteresis option
is also available to prevent temperature errors from being cleared until they fall below the
configured limits by a number of degrees. See Maximum Temperature.

Force Exceeded (128)
When the measured force output of the motor exceeds the user-set force limit, a Force
Exceeded error is asserted. This error is cleared when the force falls below the measured
threshold.
The force controller will attempt to control the force output to minimize force output beyond
the user setting.

Power Exceeded (256)
When the power burned in the stator exceeds the device or user-set maximum value, a Power
Exceeded error is asserted. This error is cleared by commanding the motor into Sleep Mode
(1).

If this error is experienced, either the maximum power user setting can be increased, or the
maximum force user setting should be decreased.
If the position controller (i.e., Position Mode (3)) is causing this error, the saturation level can
also be decreased to prevent this error.

Shaft Image Failed (512)
The shaft image is a calculation of the shaft’s alignment with the windings based on magnetic
field measurements. If this image is detected to be invalid, the shaft might not be inserted, it
might be an invalid shaft for the device, or the device may require calibration. This error is
cleared by resolving the underlying issue and commanding the motor into Sleep Mode (1).

Voltage Invalid (1024)
When the supply voltage of the motor is measured to be less than 10V, a Voltage Invalid error
is asserted. This error will disable the current sensors, resulting in force and power
calculations being disabled as well. The driver temperature sensor is also invalid in this
configuration, so it is disabled. This error is cleared by providing a supply voltage of greater
than 10V.

Communications Timeout (2048)
When in Force Mode (2), Position Mode (3), or Haptic Mode (4), a steady stream of
communications must be successfully received to avoid this error. If the timeout specified in
the USER_COMMS_TIMEOUT register elapsed between successful messages, the Comms
Timeout error is asserted. When this error is active, the motor will only produce a damping
force.
In Pulse Width Mode (11), if the motor does not receive a new pulse for the amount of time set
in PWM_TIMEOUT_MS, this error will also be set. The error will be cleared when another pulse
is received.
Users can adjust the communications timeout by writing a non-zero value to the
USER_COMMS_TIMEOUT register. This register has units of milliseconds (ms). This can also
be configured on the Modbus Page of the GUI.

Auto Zero Failed (8192)
If the auto zeroing process is interrupted in any way, this error will occur. Most commonly, this
means another error occurred. Otherwise, the auto zeroing process can time out if the shaft is
detected to be still moving after a long enough period of time. When this error is active, the
motor will only produce a damping force.
